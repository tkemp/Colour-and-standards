Current code style is as follows:

Braces on newlines in function definitions, but in line otherwise:

int func() 
{
   for (;;) {
       i++;
   }


   return 0;
}


- (BOOL) arseFromElbow:(BOOL) canTell plankThickness:(float) inches;

Blank lines between groups of related statements.

Use underscore suffix only for private ivars which back a property. Don't use an underscore for purely private ivars.

Use underscore prefix for ivars which don't back a property. That means that unprefixed and unsuffixed variables are locals or globals.
